These
data were drawn primarily from "Terrorism in Indonesia: Noordin's
Networks," a publication of the International Crisis Group (2006) and
include relational data on the 79 individuals listed in Appendix C of that
publication. The data were initially coded by Naval Postgraduate School
students as part of the course “Tracking and Disrupting Dark Networks” under
the direction of Professor Sean Everton, Co-Director of the CORE Lab, and Professor Nancy Roberts. CORE Lab Research
Assistant Daniel Cunningham reviewed and cleaned all coding made by students.
NETWORK  1-mode stacked matrix 79 x 79 person by person. Ties are undirected.
Ties include classmates; friendship; soulmates; co-location of logistical activity; co-attendance at meetings; co-participation in operations; co-attendance at training events; communications; business & financial ties.
