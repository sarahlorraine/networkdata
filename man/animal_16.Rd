\description{
Species: \emph{Papio cynocephalus}

Taxonomic class: Mammalia

Population type: free-ranging

Geographical location: Amboseli National Park, Kenya

Data collection technique: focal sampling

Interaction type: spatial proximity

Definition of interaction: These networks were constructed based on nearest neighbour data collected during focal sampling.

Edge weight type: frequency

Total duration of data collection: 30days

Time resolution of data collection (within a day):

Time span of data collection (within a day): focal follow/ad libitum

Note: Networks represent grooming interaction or association between five social groups of baboons. Each network  summarizes data collected within 30 days before and 90 days after each knockout. A natural knockout was considered to have occurred when a given alpha or beta male was present in the group for at least three months prior to his disappearance, and then he disappeared permanently from the group.
