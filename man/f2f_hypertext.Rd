\description{
This is the network of face-to-face contacts of the attendees of the ACM Hypertext 2009 conference. The ACM Conference on Hypertext and Hypermedia 2009 (HT 2009, http://www.ht2009.org/) was held in Turin, Italy over three days from June 29 to July 1, 2009. In the network, a node represents a conference visitor, and an edge represents a face-to-face contact that was active for at least 20 seconds. Multiple edges denote multiple contacts. Each edge is annotated with the time at which the contact took place.
