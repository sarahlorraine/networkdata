Character Interaction Networks for the HBO Series "Game of Thrones" (Season 1-7).
These networks were created by parsing fan-generated scripts from https://genius.com/artists/Game-of-thrones.
Pairs of characters are connected by (undirected) edges weighted by the number of interactions.

\preformatted{
There are five interaction types. Character A and Character B are connected whenever:

Character A speaks directly after Character B
Character A speaks about Character B
Character C speaks about Character A and Character B
Character A and Character B are mentioned in the same stage direction
Character A and Character B appear in a scene together
