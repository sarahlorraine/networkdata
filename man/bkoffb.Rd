\description{
These data concern interactions in a small business office, recorded by an "unobtrusive" observer. Observations were made as the observer patrolled a fixed route through the office every fifteen minutes during two four-day periods. BKOFFB contains the observed frequency of interactions; BKOFFC contains rankings of interaction frequency as recalled by the employees over the two-week period.
