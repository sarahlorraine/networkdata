\description{
records dominance relations (a directed tie from a to b means a dominates b) in a colony of 62 adult female Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata fuscata). They are known as the "Arashiyama B group." Records were made during the non-mating season, April to early October, 1976. Approach-retreat episodes involving food were recorded.

In addition, the presence of six lineages was reported. The first 4 animals belong to a lineage, and the next 14 belong to another. The following 31 are in a third lineage, and the next 6 are in the fourth. The following 6 are the fifth lineage, and the remaining animal is unrelated to the others.
