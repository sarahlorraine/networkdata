\description{
This bipartite network denotes which languages are spoken in which countries.  Nodes are countries and languages; edge weights denote the proportion (between zero and one) of the population of a given country speaking a given language.  To quote the Unicode data description:  "The main goal is to provide approximate figures for the literate, functional population for each language in each territory: that is, the population that is able to read and write each language, and is comfortable enough to use it with computers."
