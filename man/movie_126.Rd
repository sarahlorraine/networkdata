\details{
The networks were built with a movie script parser. Even after multiple manual checks, the data set can still contain minor errors (e.g. typos in character names or wrongly parsed names). This may require some additional manual checks before using the data. Please report any such issues (https://github.com/schochastics/networkdata/issues/)
