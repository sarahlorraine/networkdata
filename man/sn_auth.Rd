\description{
Chris McCarty prepared a data set for the 2008 INSNA meeting in St. Pete. He recorded all the coauthorships in the Social Networks journal from the beginning to provide a network of networkers. The result was a t-shirt with a graphic design that was sold at the meeting.
After the meeting, Lin Freeman cleaned the data set and made it available on his website. It takes the form of a matrix that records coauthorship among 475 authors who were involved in the production of 295 articles. Cell entries report the number of coaurherships displayed by pairs of authors.
