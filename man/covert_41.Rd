Project Siren began in February 1998 when a port worker informed members of the CERVO group that a container of stolen vehicles had been recently shipped to Ghana. This shipment was subsequently seized at its transit point in Anvers, Belgium. This initial tip and action led to a close monitoring of the suspects involved in the shipment. The investigation continued for 4 months (to June 1998), during which time CERVO members monitored stolen-vehicle shipments intended for Russia, Egypt, Iraq, Italy, and Switzerland. Some vehicles were also resold in Toronto. Overall, 35 cars were retrieved according to the files that were consulted.
