\description{
Species: \emph{Trichosurus cunninghami}

Taxonomic class: Mammalia

Population type: free-ranging

Geographical location: Cambarville, Victoria, Australia

Data collection technique: logger

Interaction type: social projection bipartite

Definition of interaction: The proximity loggers recorded the identity of interacting individuals (based on a threshold proximity set to detect den-sharing events) and the time and length of those interactions. From these data, den-sharing was recorded as a binary variable with �1� representing an instance of day-time den-sharing and �0� representing the use of separate dens for every pairwise combination of individuals on each of the 223 days of data collection.

Edge weight type: frequency

Total duration of data collection: 3 months

Time resolution of data collection (within a day): 1 sec

Time span of data collection (within a day): 24 hours
